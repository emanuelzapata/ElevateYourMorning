# Elevate Your Morning
Elevate Your Morning is an iOS application developed by myself and a partner in Spring 2018 as a senior project. The idea is an alarm that connects to the Apple Watch and doesnt shut off until the user is able to elevate their heartrate to a specific amount

Our project was selected as one of the top projects of Spring 2018 and we were asked to present at CSSRD(Computer Science Student Research Day). Our presentation used can be viewed here: [CSSRD.pdf](https://github.com/emanuelzapata/ElevateYourMorning/blob/master/ElevateYourMorning.pdf)

A video of the demo can also be viewed here: [Elevate Your Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmgJ-O8yvk0)
