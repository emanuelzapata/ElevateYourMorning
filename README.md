# Elevate Your Morning
Elevate Your Morning is an iOS application developed by myself and a partner in Spring 2018 as a senior project. The idea is an alarm that connects to the Apple Watch and doesnt shut off until the user is able to elevate their heartrate to a specific amount

Our project was selected as one of the top projects of Spring 2018 and we were asked to present at CSSRD(Computer Science Student Research Day)
